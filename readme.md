# TechFromScratch
TechFromScratch is a comprehensive guide to understanding and creating basic electronic components from scratch. This project provides detailed information on various components, their core principles, general approaches, and manufacturing methods.

## Usage
To view the project, open [TechFromScratch](https://cthulhuisright.github.io/TechFromScratch/) in a web browser. This will provide a main navigation page with links to all component pages via node map.

Each component page includes:
- An overview of the component.
- Usage examples.
- Core principles and equations.
- General approach to making the component.
- Detailed manufacturing methods with sorting options based on difficulty.

## Plans
- Create a source list at the end of each webpage with MLA9 format, and citation numbering/footnotes in-text
- Add images of components while gathering sources along the way for addition to the source list
- For text, use footnotes, for images, images, use figure numbers, preferabbly in different sections
- Update node graph to have dark background, while having the text still be legible
- Dark mode for component webpages is a must
- Set up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll once basic functionality for website is down
- Get the functional approach down for each component webpage, and once it works, then make it pretty with CSS/JS
- I've found that there is some pretty detailed guides on synthsizing components, so instead of having the recipies on my site, I plan to have a summary of what is done in the recpies, and a portal link window to the website if the end user is interested
- For each synthesis method, I plan to have a embeded node graph in a window alongside that recepie to help the end user more easily visualize synthesis of components
- Might use javascript to make filling out component webpages easier, like have the data in the backend, and dynamically load it into the html when needed, this does add complexity/processing time though, so might scrap, but it would make database management easier
- After I get some components down, I can make circuits from those components. Circuit building will be visualized in breadboard software, and posted to circuit webpages
- Given I get far enough in developing this website, I will have devices, which will consist of combined circuits. This is meant to be a quick reference guide for hobbists though, so maybe just focusing on components and circuits is best
